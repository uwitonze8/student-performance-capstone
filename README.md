Predicting Student Performance Using Socioeconomic and Academic Data

##Project Description
This capstone project explores the influence of academic and socioeconomic factors on student performance. Using real-world data from Portuguese and Math classes, we aim to build predictive models and generate insights using Python and Power BI.

##Power BI Dashboard Highlights
Slicers for gender, age, family support, study time, and pass/fail
Charts: Study Time vs Grades, Failures vs Pass, Alcohol vs Grades
KPI cards: Average Final Grade, Percentage Passed
AI Visual: Key Influencers for academic success

##How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open notebooks/analysis.ipynb to explore Python code
3. Open power_bi/student_performance.pbix in Power BI Desktop
4. View screenshots in screenshot/ if you canâ€™t open Power BI
5. Open presentation/Capstone_Presentation.pptx for the final summary
